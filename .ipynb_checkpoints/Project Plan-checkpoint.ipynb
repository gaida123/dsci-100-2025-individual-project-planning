    "The broad goal is **demand forecasting**, namely, what time windows are most likely to have large number of simultaneous players. This is because we need to ensure that the number of licenses on hand is sufficiently large to accommodate all parallel players with high probability. **Achieving accurate demand forecasting will minimize player frustration due to capacity issues and optimize capital expenditure on server resources and licensing.**\n",

    "### Why This Question is Important (Business Rationale)\n",
    "\n",
    "* if we know what times there are generally more people we know which times where the server is the busiest. we can prepare for these times and buy more licenses to accomdate for these players. **This directly impacts player satisfaction and ensures a seamless experience during peak gaming periods.**\n",
    "* if we know what times the server will have its heaviest load, then we can prepare the server if we need to do anything to prepare for this largest time. and then when we have the least, we could reduce the amount the server needs to save on costs. **This dynamic scaling approach maximizes cost efficiency by only running maximum capacity when necessary, directly reducing operational expenses.**\n",
    "* additionally, just in case, if we know how many people there are at peak times we know the max and the minimum for liceneses on hand to be able to run all the players. **Establishing these clear maximum and minimum capacity requirements is essential for budgeting and future infrastructure planning.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### How I will apply what we learned to find this?\n",
    "* we need to do some wrangling on the data:\n",
    "    * edit the session data to with a new column called: day_of_week, hour_of_day. use timestamp editing functions such as wday(), hour()\n",
    "    * day_of_week can be put into a categorical factor data for each day of the week\n",
    "    * time of day can be either a number (1-24) or split into categories (morning, afternoon, evening, night)\n",
    "* after wrangling, group by these variables and calculate average active players per group\n",
    "* Some visualisitons / plots that can be created:\n",
    "    * Average players by day of week using geom_col() with x = day_of_week, y = avg_players\n",
    "    * Average players by hour of day: geom_line() and geom_point() with x = hour_of_day, y = avg_players\n",
